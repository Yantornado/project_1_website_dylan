<h2>Fnatic</h2>
<p>In the steam community there are some games that involve competitive pro games.
  The game CSGO or Counter Strike-Global Offensive, has tournaments where pro teams go to compete in
  a series of matches to win a set amount of money. These tournaments are played by famous gaming teams such
  as Fnatic or Liquid. Fnatic has the best stats in the world as of right now. Fnatic have made game breaking plays such as the boost used during
  the Dreamhack Winter 2014 tournament. This boost was so game breaking that Fnatic was givin a chance to replay the game without the boost or forfeit the match.
  The boost was seen as cheat in the game. Fnatic autimatically denied the rematch losing the match and the tournament.</p>

<h2>Team Liquid</h2>
<p>Team Liquid is also an extrodinary CounterStrike team. They don't only play CS but it is one of their bigger games.
  Liquid is known for having one of the biggest "chokes" in the history of CSGO. They had the lead and needed one point to win
  the match, but the enemy team came all the way back winning the game and eliminating team Liquid from the tournament.
  Team Liquid since then has tried their best to bring that reputation to its grave. They came into the next tournament beating every team
  making it to the final two teams. There Liquid was finally eliminated keeping their reputation of having the biggest "choke" stay
  alive.</p>
